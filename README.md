Our project is an implementation of the Tron game, also known
as Light Cycles. Moving bikes are placed in a cubic arena, where 
they are free to move around. As each bike moves, a wall extends from
the back of the bike, which covers the path that the bike travels.
Any collision with a wall removes the bike and its corresponding walls
from the arena. The bike is free to move along the arena cube as long 
as it doesn't collide with a wall.

To start the game, run the lightcycle.html file in a web browser. It should
open up the game in the window and begin moving the bike. The game gives 
control of the blue bike with a number of controls.

=====================
Movement Controls: 

W - speed up (maximum double default speed)
A - turn left (relative to current direction)
S - slow down (minimum half default speed)
D - turn right (relative to current direction)

======================
Camera Controls: 

The camera starts from a third-perspective view anchored to the bike. 
The controls for it are as follows: 

Left arrow - Rotate camera left around bike
Right arrow - Rotate camera right around bike
Up arrow - Tilt camera upwards

It can be switched to a free-camera view which can be moved freely.
In free-camera mode, the controls are as follows:

J - strafe left
L - strafe right

I - move forward
K - move backward
Up arrow - move upwards
Down arrow - move downwards

Left arrow - rotate left
Right arrow - rotate right
Z - rotate upwards
X - rotate downwards

=======================
Miscellaneous Controls:

P - pauses/unpauses the game. No movement or camera control is allowed 
    while the game is paused and the screen darkens to indicate this.

=======================
Details:

There are two main aspects of the world: the arena and the camera. The
arena is a 1000x1000x1000 cube which stores all of the bikes and walls.
The camera follows the player for the most part unless it is detached
into free mode.

Bikes are first initialized individually by the world, which adds it into
its array of objects. Every bike is also associated with its own wall, 
uniquely identified by its bike. As the bike changes direction, it detaches
the current wall, pushes it into the list of world objects, and creates a 
new one to grow.

Each bike and wall has its own color, consisting of lighting as well. The
arena's walls and floor consist of a repeated texture. When the game is
paused, both the lighting and texture are darkened.

To create the bike image, we used the image loader found at 
https://github.com/frenchtoast747/webgl-obj-loader. It processes an image
in .obj file form and generates the vertices that creates it.

Collision detection is done through the nearestWalls function, which checks
all walls to see if a bike is between the two endpoints of any of them.
If so, it is considered a collision, and the bike and its walls are 
subsequently removed from the arena.
